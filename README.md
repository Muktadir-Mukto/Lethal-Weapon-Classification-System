# Lethal-Weapon-Classification-System

Classifier:
Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points.
The classifier is the algorithm or technique used to classify data
A weapon classifier can classify weapons based on some information extracted from the weapon image such as weapon size, shape - body, magazine, grip, muzzle, etc.

The need for a weapon classifier:
Every type of weapon has its own role to play in a confrontation. Selecting the right weapon at the right time can give a tactical advantage.
Weapon management and distribution can be a hassle during an emergency situation or wartime situation.
Lethal weapons and non-lethal weapons must be properly distinguished to prevent cases such as the Minneapolis incident of April 2021.
Can be implemented in other systems such as weapon detection and crime detection systems to enhance performance.
